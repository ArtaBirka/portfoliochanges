                    <p> Our product is ecological and we wanted to cater to restaurants interested in being more "green" , that is why we chose a color palette that has tones from nature as well as a pop of yellow. We chose fonts that are easy to read and feel friendly. </p>

                    <h2>Design thinking</h2>

                    <p> The process from A to Z took a lot of planning, including reaserch, interviews with users to make an user friendly interface and testing. To make this interface for the finished product we used flexbox and grid while coding.  </p>
