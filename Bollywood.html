                    <p> This website was designed for different kinds of dancer levels, so it needed to look both profesional but welcoming. I decided to make the page in a way that would direct you to your level by having descriptions of each class and what you needed to know all in one place, later on I also added explenatory pictured under each class.</p>

                    <h2>Design elements</h2>

                    <p> Before choosing any design elements, we reaserched the dance and culture behind it. We consulted with a dancer and decided on colors most commonly seen in the dance. We decided on the following color palette and named them to further deepen our idea behind them: Old ruby, Soft peach, Mellow beige. </p>
