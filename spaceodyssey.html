                    <h2>Layout</h2>

                    <p> There were 3 different layout ideas. This website was designed for families, that is why I went with the first one. The image is the first thing the user sees because it is suited for all ages - it is easy to comprehend. The available classes are in a row (using proximity) with the important details highlited, so they are easy to find.</p>

                    <h2>Photoshop</h2>

                    <p>To create a visualization of the trip accurately I decided to include the activities alongside the map of the trip itself. I did this by taking different images of the activities, destinations and transportation and cutting out the most important parts. I made edits to the lighting and colors and then put them together. </p>
